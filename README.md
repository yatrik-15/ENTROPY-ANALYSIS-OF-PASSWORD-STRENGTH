ðŸ”‘ Password Entropy Analyzer

A web-based dashboard that performs a mathematical analysis of password strength using Shannon Entropy. This project was built for the "Innovative Assignment" in the Mathematical Foundation for Computer Science (MFCS) course.

1. About This Project

In cybersecurity, "password strength" is often enforced with simple, arbitrary rules like "must have 8 characters and one symbol." These rules don't capture the true, mathematical essence of security: predictability.

This project moves beyond those simple rules to provide a quantitative, data-driven analysis of password lists. It's a web-based dashboard that allows a user to:

Paste in a list of passwords.

Upload a large password file (like rockyou.txt).

The application then performs a complete mathematical analysis and presents the results in a clean dashboard, showing the true randomness (or lack thereof) of the dataset.

2. Features

Dual Input Modes: Analyze data by pasting text directly or by uploading large local files.

Shannon Entropy Calculation: The core of the project. It calculates the true information entropy of the character set in "bits per character."

Strength Rating: Provides a user-friendly rating (from "Very Weak" to "Very Strong") based on the entropy score.

Character Set Analysis: A detailed breakdown of the unique characters found, categorized into:

a-z (Lowercase)

A-Z (Uppercase)

0-9 (Numbers)

!@# (Symbols & Extended ASCII)

Frequency Visualization: Generates a dynamic bar chart (using Chart.js) to visualize the Top 30 most frequent characters, providing clear visual proof of predictability.

Modern UI: A clean, responsive, single-page application built with Tailwind CSS.

3. The Mathematical Foundation: Shannon Entropy

The entire analysis is based on the Shannon Entropy formula, which measures the average level of "information," "surprise," or "uncertainty" in a set of data.

$$H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(x_i) \log_2(p(x_i))$$

Here's what that means in this project:

H(X): The final Entropy Score in "bits." A higher score means more uncertainty and a stronger, less predictable password list.

p(x_i): The probability of a single character (x_i) appearing. We calculate this by:
p('a') = (Total times 'a' appears) / (Total number of all characters)

What it tells us: A low entropy score (e.g., 2.5 bits) proves that the password list is highly predictable. A high score (e.g., 5.0 bits) proves it is very random. The rockyou.txt file, for example, has a very low entropy, and this tool can prove it mathematically.

4. How to Use

This is a single-file static web application. No installation is required.

Clone or Download:

git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Your-Repo-Name.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Your-Repo-Name.git)


(Or just download the index.html file).

Open in Browser:
Navigate to the project folder and double-click the index.html file.

Use the App:

Click the "Paste Text" tab and paste in your data, then click "Analyze Text."

Click the "Upload File" tab, select a .txt file (like rockyou.txt), and click "Analyze File."

5. Technologies Used

HTML5: For the core structure of the application.

Tailwind CSS: For all styling, layout, and the responsive, dark-mode design.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all application logic, including:

File reading (FileReader)

The calculateEntropy() and analyzeData() functions.

DOM manipulation.

Chart.js: For rendering the beautiful "Top 30 Character Frequency" bar chart.
